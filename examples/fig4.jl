# This replicates Fig. 4 in the paper "Many Physical Design Problems are Sparse QCQPs"
# In particular, we aim to replicate Fig. 4c (the optimized design) as well as the
# returned optimal point. The implementation follows section 4 of the paper

using JuMP, Gurobi, PhysicalDesignSparseQCQP

## Define the problem

# Material refractive index
n = 2.3 + 0.03im
design_dielectric = n^2
# Size of design domain, in wavelengths
design_domain = 4
# Phase of reflected light
reflected_phase = -0.3π
r_target = cis(reflected_phase)

# PML

# Simulation options
N = design_domain * 20

model = NormalIncidenceFDFD1D(
    design_domain,
    design_dielectric,
    N,
    pml
)

## Define the QCQP
# Eq. 39
# Objective function
# max real(E_scattered[idx_monitor]' * r_target)
# note: don't really need to worry about normalization
# There are two approaches we can take to launching the
# incident field:
# 1. enforce unit amplitude in J current
# 2. Launch eigenmode by setting electric and magnetic currents
# Option (1) allows us the smallest PDE and number of constraints,
# cutting it down by factor of 2 because we will only solve over
# the E-field. However, the current source creates a counter-
# propagating wave we will have to subtract from our objective
# Option (2) allows us to express the reflected field directly
# from the result, but requires a larger PDE, in addition to the
# constraints that are required to be implemented
# max real((E_total[idx_monitor] - E_in[idx_monitor])' * r_target)
# max real(E_total[idx_monitor]' * r_target - E_in[idx_monitor]' * r_target)
# E_in is independent of the design variables, so we see that it
# contributes only a constant factor, and we are left with
# max real(E_total[idx_monitor]' * r_target)
# as the same maximum as the scattered field

# Design constraint
# (𝐋(χ1)ψ - ξ)† 𝐃ᵢ(𝐋(χ2)ψ - ξ) = 0 i ∈ I_design
# (𝐋(χi)ψ - ξ)† 𝐃ᵢ(𝐋(χi)ψ - ξ) = 0 i ∈ I_PML
# (𝐋(χi)ψ - ξ) = 0 i ∈ I_PML

(;D, Lχ1, Lχ2, ξ) = build_component_constraints(model)


# Interlude: attempt solve w/ Gurobi

# Define the SDP
