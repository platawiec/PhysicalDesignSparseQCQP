## Notebooks

To test the notebooks, you can simply install Pluto in your environment and from the Julia REPL perform:

```
julia> using Pluto; Pluto.run()
```

The `examples` directory is self-contained, one may also `cd` to `examples` and, from the Julia package manager, run `instantiate` to install dependencies, including Pluto.

```
julia>] instantiate
```

Following this, once the dependencies are installed you may run Pluto. The notebooks will automatically run once selected, though they may take several minutes to finish.
